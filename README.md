Self
===

Self is an app for exploring how to live a more fulfilling and efficient life at the daily level. How much time do you
really spend getting stuff done versus wasting time? What activities reward you the most and make you happiest?

Self is mostly a tech/product experiment. The current stack is a back-end built with the Express framework for Node
and an AngularJS front-end. The database is MongoDB. The main authentication service is Passport. The whole thing 
is generated by Yeoman which includes Bower (dependencies) and Grunt (automated tasks). 99% of the project
is regular Javascript. Feel free to contribute or use this as a reference for tackling a Node app.
