Self
===

Self is an app for exploring how to live a more fulfilling and efficient life at the daily level. How much time do you
really spend getting stuff done versus wasting time? What activities reward you the most and make you happiest?

Self is mostly a tech/product experiment. The current stack is a back-end built with the Express framework for Node,
along with an AngularJS front-end. The database is MongoDB. The main Authentication service is Passport. 99% of the project
is regular Javascript with one Coffeescript file (because I can).
